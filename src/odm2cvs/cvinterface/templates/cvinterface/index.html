                Version 2 of the Observations Data Model (ODM2) has several controlled vocabularies. This web page was
                developed to promote consistency between different instances of ODM2 through a community moderated
                system for managing the master controlled vocabularies. This web page displays the master controlled
                vocabulary entries and allows you to request additions or changes to these. You may then use these terms
                in an ODM2 database or in files that are intended to be interoperable with ODM2.
